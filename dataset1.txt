Lovings and feels, wicked as they are
Coming with fears, platonic so far
Boy had a girl, I had you boy
Misunderstood, no joy, no more

Lovings and feels, wicked as they are
Coming with fears, platonic so far
Left it open, talking by my heart
Cause I'm dying hoping
That압, where it all starts

Is this love, is this love
That압 question not asked
If love is this love
Don앖 crave it too much
Is love is this love
That압 question not asked
If love is this love
Don앖 crave it too much

And when you smile
And I glow
You got me now
And I have you boy
And when you smile
And I glow
You got me now
And I have you boy

Lovings and feels
In our favourite bar
You kissed my red lips
Lighted my cigar
I looked right at you
Boy, you not my guy
So glad I met you
Thank you and goodbye

Is this love, is this love
That압 question not asked
If love is this love
Don앖 crave it too much
Is love is this love
That압 question not asked
If love is this love
Don앖 crave it too much

And when you smile
And I glow
You got me now
And I have you boy
And when you smile
And I glow
You got me now
And I have you boy
